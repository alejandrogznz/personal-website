            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Alejandro, and I am currently a prospective Masters of Computer Science Student.<br/>
                Professionally, my interests mainly range from backend web developement/software engineering. I have several projects under me that utilize web APIs, RESTful architecture, and 
                knowledge of cloud services such as Google Cloud.<br/>
                Along with web developement, I have interests in Algorithm design
                Aside from professional interests, I'm also interested in learning photography, visiting museums, and eventually 
                traveling to national parks in California.
